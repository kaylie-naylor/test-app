Cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.","Gradually whisk in cream, stirring constantly, to incorporate cream into butter. Drizzle in lemon juice, then add lemon zest, while stirring constantly. Keep stirring until sauce coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes.","Remove from heat and stir in grated Pecorino Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.
